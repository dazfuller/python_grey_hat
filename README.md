# Grey Hat Python - Code Samples

This is a collection of samples from the book [Grey Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3170679-grey-hat-python) by [Justin Seintz](https://twitter.com/jms_dot_py?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). This is primarily for myself to refer back to as I'm following the book on OSX rather than Linux or Windows as shown in the book.  But if it's useful for anyone else then great.

Set up using:

    Python 2.7
    VirtualEnv
